# üè• Medical Document Automation with Google Cloud Document AI & BigQuery

Streamline medical insurance claim processing with advanced AI techniques, reducing manual efforts and improving efficiency with real-time analytics.

## üìö Project Overview
This project leverages **Google Cloud Document AI** (Vertex AI and Generative AI) to automate the processing of medical insurance claim documents. By integrating **OCR** for digitization and **NLP** for content categorization, the system efficiently extracts structured data with high accuracy and integrates seamlessly with **BigQuery** for advanced data analysis.


## üöÄ Setup and Implementation

### 1. Create a Processor
- Navigate to the **Google Cloud Document AI** console.
- Create a custom processor for structured data extraction.
- Select the appropriate region and enable Google-managed storage and encryption.

### 2. Processor Configuration
- **Field Definition**: Identify fields such as `claim_number`, `company_name`, `service_date`, `amount_billed`, `amount_paid`, and `medical_procedure`.
- **Field Attributes**: Define data types (e.g., Number, Date, Currency) and set occurrence parameters (Required, Optional).

### 3. Document Labeling
- **Upload Documents**: Import PDFs into the labeling console from Google Cloud Storage.
- **Annotation**: Use built-in annotation tools to label fields. Leverage the foundation model for initial suggestions and manually correct any inaccuracies.
